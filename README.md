# About Jewel CMS

Jewel CMS is a fast, modern system aimed at tech-savvy users and developers. It has a few aims:

 * To provide a lightweight alternative to other CMS platforms.
 * To make publishing a breeze.
 * To provide sensible default settings.
 * To not rely on a huge number of plugins.

Jewel is built in PHP and uses jQuery, Twig and Bootstrap.

Jewel aims to provide a lightweight alternative to more mainstream products, such as WordPress and Drupal.

# A brief history

Jewel CMS is a fork of Injader 2.5.0. The work that was originally intended for Injader v3 has been repackaged as
Jewel CMS 1.0.0.

The source code is undergoing a major overhaul. For at least the next few versions, don't be surprised if you find
some really bad code. I'm cleaning it up.
